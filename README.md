# Earthquake_Challenge 
Module 13

Overview:
This project was designed to create a simple website showing earthquakes on a world map. The final version of the map includes three different base layers (street map, satellite, dark), and three different overlays (all earthquakes, tectonic plates, major earthquakes) within the past seven days.

Resources:
index.html: html, css, js, leaflet
style.css: minor styling
challenge_logic.js: mpbox, openstreetmap, earthquake.usgs.gov, githubusercontent(fraxen)

Results:
The index page is a map of the entire world centered on latitude 40.7 and longitude -94.5. Using a zoom level of 3, which puts approximately 85% of the world on the screen at a given time. The default base layer is the street map. All three overlays are selected by default.
There is a simple legend on the bottom right showing the color for earthquake magnitudes. One minor flaw in this challenge is that two of the overlays require different scales for the earthquake magnitudes. The basic earthquake overlay scale colors every earthquake over 5 with one color. The major earthquakes overlay differentiates between earthquakes of magnitude 5-6, and earthquakes over 6. So, any earthquakes over 6 will have two different colors depending on which overlay is active. The default is the base earthquake overlay.

Summary:
This is a good project where we got to work with base layers and overlays.This project was created to show on a website earthquakes on a world map. There are three layers of the earthquakes, tectonic plates, major earthquakes. The world map is center with a latitude of 40.7 and Longitude -94.5. This project was intresting to create the map and the different view points from it where it is able to view the major earthquake layers to the variable on the maps, along with the earthquake data and the tectonic plates data.
